    <h2>2/5/2026 — Imposter Syndrome or Just Stupidity?</h2>

    <p>
        This is a question that has been sitting with me for a long time.
        I’m literally typing now on VSCode because it forces my thoughts to slow down.
        Typing in VSCode feels like a less guilty way to spend my working time trap my chaotic mind on the page
        before they spiral too far ahead of me.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of this yapping is simple, even if the answer isn’t:
        to feel better (or to make whoever is reading this feel less alone) — whether I’m actually incapable
        or just living inside imposter syndrome.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this stage, I suppose I’m a researcher.
        After some scientific training in undergrad,
        I chose to continue on to graduate school.
        I still don’t know whether that was the right decision,
        but I assume time will answer that for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        The more I learn, the more exposed I feel to my own ignorance.
        Because I came to science relatively late,
        I don’t yet have the confidence to silence the voice in my head
        that keeps pointing out I'm not a qualified researcher.
    </p>

    <p>
        I understand math, physics, and computer science shallowly. 
    <p>
        Yes, everyone says otherwise, but I wish someone would point out exactly what I’m missing. 
        And yet it's always easier being nice than being honest isn't it?
        Here, it sometimes feels like trying to judge
        whether I’m a good cook
        when everyone tasting my food is just being polite.
    </p>
        I recognize formulas, theorems, and algorithms —
        but when I watch how real scientists actually use these tools,
        I feel like a monkey trained to hold a pen
        without knowing how to write. And sometimes that monkey wonders whether it’s struggling because it’s inexperienced —
        or because it’s simply incapable.
    </p>

    <p>
        So am I just stupid, or is this imposter syndrome?
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t think this question has a clean answer—at least not one that this education 
        system offers. After coming to the U.S. for college, I noticed that people genuinely 
        avoid comparing themselves to others. That’s probably healthy. But it also leaves 
        my brain lots of potential to self-doubt. 
    </p>

    <p>
        How am I supposed to know what’s expected of a scientist?
        How much math is “enough”?
        How many papers should I have read by now?
        How good does my coding need to be?
    </p>

    <p>
        I know I work hard —
        but how does a hard worker know
        whether she’s actually on the right track?
    </p>

    <p>
        Growing up in China, comparison was common like breathing air.
        That had its problems,
        but at least I always knew where I stood.
        I didn’t have to guess.

        (Yes, I just realized that I miss the days when people told me what to do,
        so I could avoid thinking.
        Which feels wrong, because I’m basically asking for less freedom.
        But maybe freedom can feel like a cage
        if you’re a monkey who doesn’t know how to open the door.

        And to the people who say, “the bitterness of thinking is the least suffering you can have —
        labor is much harder,” I just want to say that’s not necessarily true for me.)
    </p>

    

    <p>
        Lately, I’ve been sick due to the Boston winter. 
        And when I am tick, I tend to imagine my life before my sudden death. 
        What should I spend the rest of my time if I only have 5years or 10 years to live?
        thinking about what I actually want from life.
        I want to do things I enjoy
        while still making people's life better in some tangible way.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m not particularly good at social interaction.
        I feel too much in moments that I shouldn't
        and over-reason in others when I need more empathy. 
        So, I guess I shouldn't work in people-facing roles then. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I know I genuinely enjoy learning from the basics.

        At this point, I really want to point out that many researchers don’t know how to explain their work in human language.
        And many of those who think they explain well don’t actually do a good job for me —
        or maybe they simply expect too much from my intelligence,
        in which case I apologize for my stupidity.

        To some extent, I’m also not sure whether the intention behind many researchers’ conversations
        is to teach me or to show off.

        I think I need to learn from some of my bravest friends
        and ask questions even when I feel stupid.
    </p>

    <p>
        So that being said, I’ve accepted that I’ll probably never be a theorist —
        and I think I’m okay with that. Or maybe if I am rich enough one day, 
        bored with real life I might become a hobbyist theorist? 

    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe I should build my life
        around the things I genuinely love. Which is quite a few things. 
        Sometimes I wonder if I can just own a farm and live there happily ever after with my animals.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love baking and cooking.
        I love pictures.
        I love movies.
        I love food.
        I love understanding how things work from scratch. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Right now,
        I’m learning about light interactions and color,
        and that feels oddly right.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe that means becoming a food scientist.<br>
        Or a movie scientist.<br>
        Or a food photographer.
        At this stage of writing I'm not sure what am I writing about anymore. 
        Or maybe that's the point. 
    </p>

     <p>
        Maybe it doesn’t have to be just one thing yet.
        I still have at least three or four years left in school.
        I realize now that I haven’t explicitly said this —
        I’m doing a PhD.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s awfully exciting to become a “doctor”
        who can’t actually save people
        (To my defense it's not like I don't want to, but I faint at the sight of blood).
        So yes, I’m a PhD student.
        Maybe I’m confused in the way PhD students often are,
        because I didn’t fully think it through when I applied.
        My broke undergrad ass saw the stipend and fancy microscope pictures in all the lab websites and just jumped in.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t hate my life.
        I enjoy at least half of my work.
        I just keep wondering
        how I can spend the rest of my life better.

        And instead of talking out loud, I choose to type it down —
        not because I have to, but because I’m currently sitting in a room with extremely thin walls,
        and I don’t want people to think I’m a psychopath.

        Oki, that’s the end of my yapping :)))
